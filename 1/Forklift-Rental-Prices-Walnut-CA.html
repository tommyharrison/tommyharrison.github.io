For example, a common system would involve a pallet truck feeding a reach truck in a unit load storage application, while the reach truck provides let-down for the pallet truck in low-level order picking.

<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
