<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>If you need electric lift trucks, we carry a product for you. We are mainly looking for Hydraulic Jacks,Impact Wrench and pneumatic tools queries. The two basic types of lift kit are body lift and suspension lift. It should be noted that Lifted Trucks do have their drawbacks.

For example, a common system would involve a pallet truck feeding a reach truck in a unit load storage application, while the reach truck provides let-down for the pallet truck in low-level order picking. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>
