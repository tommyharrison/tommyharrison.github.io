<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials.

The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive. Backed with a team of professional and experts of the industry, we are involved in offering Roll Pallet Truck. We also rent out electric forklift batteries and battery chargers to eliminate your forklift downtime. Forklift attachment manufacturers offer online calculators to estimate the safe lifting capacity when using a particular attachment.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load. If you are looking for a forklift dealer in northern and central Ohio, visit Mid-Ohio Forklifts. Before installing any attachment contact your local authorized dealer of your forklift brand and ask them to begin re-rating your lift according to the attachment you want to install.</p>
