<p>All parts are made of stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin, and bolt, etc. Warehouses and fulfillment centers with tall and deep racking commonly use reach trucks.

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>

<p>Scales - fork truck-mounted scales enable operators to efficiently weigh the pallets they handle without interrupting their workflow by travelling to a platform scale. These hand pallet trucks are equipped with a weight indicator or scale, which allows you to easily weigh loads during transport for maximum efficiency. Designed for light, medium and heavy-duty material handling, our internal combustion (IC) counterbalanced trucks are equipped with the unique Toyota System of Active Stability (Toyota SAS) to enhance operator safety and comfort.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>I found the right forklift on Damoli's website and just ordered it over the phone. So this is not the same type of lift as a body lift kit.
