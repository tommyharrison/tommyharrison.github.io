<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs, purchasing equipment may not make sense, MH Equipment features one of the largest material handling and construction equipment rental fleets in the Midwest. This is very important to the safety of the forklift operator. LOAD CENTER: The horizontal longitudinal distance from the intersection of the horizontal load-carrying surfaces and vertical load-engaging faces of the forks (or equivalent load positioning structure) to the center of gravity of the load.</p>
<p>We replace your lead-acid battery-powered electric trucks - regardless of manufacturer or brand - with our EFG with lithium-ion batteries. Most Forklift Dealers will provide operator training (sometimes with a cost) with the purchase of a new forklift.
