<h3>Electric Forklift Saint Clair MO</h3>
<p>For off road purposes, lifting a truck is the best way to improve its performance. In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>
<p>RT forklift manufacturers—and there are more than you might think, some with surprisingly broad product lines—are pursuing ongoing refinement of their machines. Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>

<p>Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond Certified Technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. Of course, every lift truck will need maintenance and repairs, so renting under a full-service maintenance program can eliminate the risk of unexpected budget-busting repair bills.</p>

Available in two main configurations, internal combustion (IC) and electric, standard forklifts represent the greatest potential for weight capacity - with the deck stacked heavily in favor of IC lifts. Reach trucks are the most common and are frequently used on shelves that have simple levels for a single load.</p>
