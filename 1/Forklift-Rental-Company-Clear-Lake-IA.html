Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>Place empty truck on an initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.
