Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>

<p>While standard counterbalance forklifts need a good amount of space to make turns, a three-wheel forklift can actually spin in a very tight circle. Of course, Chevrolet already produces a number of fantastic off-road trucks with dedicated trims designed to take on a wide range of trails out there. They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>With over 80 years' experience in the materials handling industry, we've developed a range of robust, efficient and performance enhancing forklift trucks and warehouse equipment; ensuring your applications are completed efficiently, safely and smoothly. Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker.</p>

Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>

<p>The most complex type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit, which allows your truck to be boosted higher than that of a body kit. Yale has been manufacturing materials handling equipment for over 140 years. Since 1949, Kalmar has been the preferred brand among quality-aware, heavy lift truck drivers and owners. Most rough terrain forklifts have safety glass paneling around the cab, too.</p>
<p>With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents. Don't pay for a 5,000 lb. capacity truck to move 2,000 lbs. If it is not meant for roller chain pulleys then forklifts would require much taller cylinders to lift up the load to an equivalent height.</p>
