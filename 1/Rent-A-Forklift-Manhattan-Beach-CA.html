<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>

The wheels on most lifted trucks are quite a bit larger than those on standard-sized trucks. More importantly, we provide every one of the products and services that you require to oversee and care for your fork lifts.</p>
