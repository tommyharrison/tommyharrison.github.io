In addition, the use of a powered industrial truck in a location for which that type of powered industrial truck is not designated for use, for example due to a flammable atmosphere, can result in a fire or explosion. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
