It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>

<h2>Fork Truck Certification Galena</h2>
<p>Capable of lifting 20,000 pounds, this is the latest of Load Lifter's high-visibility forklifts. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>

Our inventory of Lifted and Customized trucks is diverse and ever-changing featuring a wide variety of well-known trucks across many exceptional brands, such as the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, GMC Sierra 3500HD, Chevy Silverado 2500HD or the Ram 2500.</p>
<p>All hydraulic functions can be controlled using proportional finger tips for precise and safe load handling. Most warehouses in the United States use counterbalance forklifts to move products, manage inventory, and improve efficiency for all sorts of cargo-related tasks.

Spacing: The process of putting most trafficked goods in different aisles for less congestion of order pickers and better optimization of travel - the most costly factor of order picking.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Our exclusive ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers industry-leading lift, lower and travel speeds and easy-to-use ergonomic controls enhance operator comfort for greater productivity. A lifted vehicle becomes naturally top heavy, which causes it to be sensitive while cornering and braking. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>
