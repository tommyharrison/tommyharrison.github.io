The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company.

These machines can also navigate fields, pastures, pens, and loading areas. The largest of the "core" line of cushion trucks, the 15,500 lb. truck has the largest counterweight and the largest lifting capacity. Because of the additional weight from larger tires on your lifted truck, frequent oil changes are recommended when you lift your truck or SUV.</p>
