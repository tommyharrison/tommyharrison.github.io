If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it.
