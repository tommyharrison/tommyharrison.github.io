<p>However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities. Lifted trucks look right at home on any beach, and their increased performance makes traversing sand more satisfying than an ocean breeze. Our forklift trucks are dependable and reliable to get to the job done in a safe and efficient manner. With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner and the mast at full rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, elevate the load to its maximum height.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
