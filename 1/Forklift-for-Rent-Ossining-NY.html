<p>However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities. Lifted trucks look right at home on any beach, and their increased performance makes traversing sand more satisfying than an ocean breeze.

A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
