When you book with us, you are booking with an experienced company with trainers that have had years of experience working in warehouses picking stock at all different heights on the order picker, trainers that have been safety representatives and store-men. Yes, you can rent indoor forklift for warehouses. Also, a strap or chain is used to attach the man basket to the carriage of the forklift.</p>
<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches.

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
