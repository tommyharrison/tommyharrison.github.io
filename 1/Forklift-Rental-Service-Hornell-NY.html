Reliable Toyota Industrial engines offer faster acceleration and lift speeds, increasing productivity during stacking, loading and unloading goods, as well as horizontal transport functions. These forklifts are different from ordinary industrial forklifts, as they are extra-strong and rugged vehicles, that look a little bit like a tractor.</p>
<p>Both Gasoline engine type and LP gas engine type have stronger power, hence suitable for heavy goods cargo work, while Electric and fuel cell types have zero emission and great quietness, which are more suitable for in-warehouse work. Weight of vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of vehicle beyond front wheels); front wheels act as fulcrum or pivot point.</p>
