The extremely versatile Toyota Walkie Reach Truck assists in decreasing operator fatigue and downtime by making maneuvering products through the warehouse quick and efficient.

Featuring an air spring with superior ride quality, this unit softens typical loaded ride conditions by transferring load from the vehicle's leaf spring to the Hellwig Air Spring.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
