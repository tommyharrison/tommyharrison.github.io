Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design. The good news is you don't need to have any experience of driving a forklift truck to start learning with an accredited training provider. Our entire range of electric order pickers is characterised by extremely robust construction. The new products offer advances in efficiency technology with their optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking.</p>
