We specialise in NZ forklifts including electric forklifts, VNA forklifts and used forklifts for sale.

We sell, rent and support the full lines of Cat, Mitsubishi, Jungheinrich and Taylor Lift Trucks. If you're a more adventurous driver that likes to go off-road, a lifted truck is a great way to enable you to challenge yourself to take on more difficult terrain.</p>

To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
