<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful. A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser.
