<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. Here at East Midlands Forklifts , we provide comprehensive forklift training for a variety of trucks and at various levels. An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>This package has standard off-road wheels, but a 4-inch performance lift-kit and slim line fenders. Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks. In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.</p>
