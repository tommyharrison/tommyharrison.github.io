<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road.

<p>Usually they can reach heights up to 390″ Order pickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. You can also use an electric forklift outdoors.
