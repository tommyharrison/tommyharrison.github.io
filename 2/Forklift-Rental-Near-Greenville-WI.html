<p>For the development of modern Forklift Trucks, Hyster-Yale Materials plays a major role in bringing the connected device technology across the trucking industry.

<p>Hiring a forklift means that you won't have to rent or buy a permanent forklift and can merely acquire one for the busy period in order to pick up the slack.
