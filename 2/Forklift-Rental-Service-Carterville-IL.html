<h3>Forklift Truck Manufacturer Carterville IL 62918</h3>
<p>If you prefer to communicate by email about our forklift sale in Surrey, complete our easy contact form and we'll get right back to you. Unlike other industrial trucks, they don't have a mast and use pallet forks or a platform to haul loads several inches off of the ground. From sit-down to stand-up electric counterbalanced forklifts, you can find the right model to suit your business.</p>
<p>Some of the conditions which may affect stability are, ground and floor conditions, grade, speed, loading (trucks equipped with attachments behave as partially loaded trucks even when operated without a load on the attachment), battery weight, dynamic and static forces, and the judgment exercised by the operator. The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team.</p>
