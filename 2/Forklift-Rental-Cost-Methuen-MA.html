<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks.

<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail.

Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>
