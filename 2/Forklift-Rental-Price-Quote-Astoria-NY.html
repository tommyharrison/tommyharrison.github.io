OSHA Section 1910.178 lists safety procedures for fork trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, motorized hand trucks, and other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or internal combustion engines.‚Äù The most important rule is that each forklift reaches the basic standards for safety.</p>
<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us.

The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>

First, forklifts can be classified according to the type of engine. Renting a forklift requires almost as much forethought as buying one.</p>
