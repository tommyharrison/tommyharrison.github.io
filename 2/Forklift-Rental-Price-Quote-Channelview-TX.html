<p>Safety requirements relating to the elements of design, operation and maintenance of powered industrial trucks - not including vehicles intended primarily for earth moving or over the road hauling. If you know you need a forklift, but aren't sure if you'll encounter another equipment need with the same project, look no further. Industrial trucks are categorized into seven classes based on characteristics, such as engine type, design and size.</p>
<p>This product is made in USA, and it can handle with any materials you may have. The heavier the load - and the higher you lift - the further forward the combined center of gravity goes. Crown's VNA trucks, designed with comfort and stability, are built to perform and help maximize your warehouse space. They can be used to speed up movement of items between different workstations This is just the beginning of some of the work places and environments in which pallet jacks can be useful and aid in increasing workplace efficiency and overall effectiveness.</p>
<p>The Industrial Truck Association has placed powered industrial trucks into 7 classes.

This means that they are perfect for transporting heavy loads across rugged terrain, with some models handling up to 3 tonnes per load.</p>

If other tests of tests for trucks over 20,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.
