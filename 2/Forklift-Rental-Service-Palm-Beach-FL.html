<h2>Linde Lift Trucks Palm Beach</h2>
<p>Our award-winning products will ensure your operators are working in one of the safest forklifts on the market.

<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself.

Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
