<p>There is nothing like the ride that is achieved from air suspension. The order picker forklift has a small platform big enough for the operator to stand behind the forks with controls for operating the forks. Suspension lift kits can raise a truck a full foot from where it started, and they aren't just lifting up the truck's body and putting it back again. Counterbalanced and noncounterbalanced Fork Lift Trucks and Reach Trucks — The maximum weight; expressed in pounds, of a 48 inches homogeneous cube (24 inches load center) that a truck can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.</p>

Double-deep trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks, and they are ideal for warehouses where a lot of pallet loads are stored in each bay.</p>

A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
