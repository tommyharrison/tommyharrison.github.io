They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.

<p>Single-reach models extend the length of one pallet and double-reach trucks extend the length of two. If you want to be well equipped to take part in all the off-roading opportunities North Carolina has to offer, buying a lifted truck is the perfect solution. These lifts allow you to add beefier off-road tires and heavier suspension components but do come at a higher cost.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
