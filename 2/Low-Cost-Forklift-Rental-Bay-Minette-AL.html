This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits. This is a testament to the impact that lift truck manufacturers and dealers have on the U.S. economy, says Johnson, and also the critical nature of operator training and safety in the context of the workplace.</p>

Longitudinal stability isn't the only concern for lift truck operators. This is a lifting aid that you can adjust to your requirements, ensuring an efficient workflow, safe for both operators and goods.</p>
<h2>Pallet Truck Bay Minette</h2>
