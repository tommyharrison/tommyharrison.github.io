<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Telehandlers provide substantial lift heights over standard forklifts. Considering the materials handling industry's recent development in automation, real-time responsiveness and end-to-end efficiency are building communication between the management of forklift trucks and people who operate them. LP, gas diesel, electric, pneumatic or cushion, we have the forklift rental you need.</p>

In the region where I work, small businesses (as opposed to the large manufacturing and commercial construction companies I normally consult with) often lack the resources for safety training. The industrial forklift —also called a large capacity forklift—combines the functionalities of a warehouse forklift with that of a telehandler.</p>
<p>So that your handling capacity stays high under all circumstances, Linde Material Handling offers a large selection of particularly agile pallet trucks. This allows our electric reach trucks to transport loads weighing up to 2.5 tons quickly and safely to their destination. Renting your forklift can also mean significantly lower up-front costs and the ability to plan on consistent monthly expenditures.</p>

I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous.
