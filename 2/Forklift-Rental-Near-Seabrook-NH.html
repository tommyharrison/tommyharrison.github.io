<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. Our Electric hand pallet truck is very simple to handle and remarkably maneuverable and safe in every way. Nissan was the No. 1 forklift retailer in the world last year, earning $8.562 billion through their materials handling division.

YaleÂ® trucks are manufactured in an ISO 9001:2008 registered facility and range in capacity from 2,000 to 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
