The lift truck market value and volume are contributed by the revenue and the forklift truck units sold across North America, Asia Pacific, Middle-East Africa and Latin America.

<h3>New, Used, Or Rental Forklifts Alexander AR 72002</h3>
<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>The machine known as a stockpicker is an electric forklift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads. Body lifts can increase the height of a truck by up to three inches and can allow for larger tires on the truck. A "lifted truck" is a truck whose suspension has been modified to accommodate larger tires, usually 35 inches or bigger.</p>
